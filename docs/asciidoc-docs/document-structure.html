<h1>Document Structure</h1>
</div>
<div id="content">
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On this page, you&#8217;ll learn about the overall structure of an AsciiDoc document.
Don&#8217;t worry about the details of the syntax at this point as it will be covered thoroughly later in the documentation.
Right now, we&#8217;re just aiming to get a sense of what makes up an AsciiDoc document.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_documents">Documents</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AsciiDoc is a plain text writing format with no boilerplate enclosure or prologue.
An AsciiDoc document may consist of only a single sentence (or a single character, to be academic).
The following example is a valid AsciiDoc document with a single paragraph containing a single sentence:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-none hljs">This is a basic AsciiDoc document.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, you can have more content than this.
An AsciiDoc document is a series of blocks stacked on top of one another (by line).
These blocks are typically offset from one another by blank lines (though not always required).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To expand the previous document from one paragraph to two, you&#8217;d separate the two paragraphs by a blank line:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-none hljs">This is a basic AsciiDoc document.

This document contains two paragraphs.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An AsciiDoc document may begin with a document header.
Although the document header is optional, it&#8217;s often used to specify the document title and define document-wide configuration and reusable text in the form of document attributes.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-none hljs">= Document Title
:reproducible:

This is a basic AsciiDoc document by {author}.

This document contains two paragraphs.
It also has a header that specifies the document title.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost any combination of blocks constitutes a valid AsciiDoc document (with some structural requirements dictated by the document type).
Documents can range from a single sentence to a multi-part book.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_lines">Lines</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The line is a significant construct in AsciiDoc.
A line is defined as text that&#8217;s separated on either side by either a newline character or the boundary of the document.
Many aspects of the syntax must occupy a whole line.
That&#8217;s why we say AsciiDoc is a line-oriented language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a section title must be on a line by itself.
The same is true for an attribute entry, a block title, a block attribute list, a block macro, a list item, a block delimiter, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example of a section title, which must occupy a single line</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-none hljs">== Section Title</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example of an attribute entry, which must also occupy at least one line</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-none hljs">:name: value</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example of an attribute entry that extends to two lines</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-none hljs">:name: value \
more value</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Blank lines can also be significant.
A single blank line separates the header from the body.
Many blocks are also separated by a blank line, as you saw in the two paragraph example earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In contrast, lines within paragraph content are insignificant.
Keep these points in mind as you&#8217;re learning about the AsciiDoc syntax.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_blocks">Blocks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Blocks in an AsciiDoc document lay down the document structure.
Some blocks may contain other blocks, so the document structure is inherently hierarchical (i.e., a tree structure).
You can preview this section structure, for example, by enabling the automatic table of contents.
Examples of blocks include paragraphs, sections, lists, delimited blocks, tables, and block macros.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Blocks are easy to identify because they&#8217;re usually offset from other blocks by a blank line (though not always required).
Blocks always start on a new line, terminate at the end of a line, and are aligned to the left margin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every block can have one or more lines of block metadata.
This metadata can be in the form of block attributes, a block anchor, or a block title.
These metadata lines must be above and directly adjacent to the block itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sections, non-verbatim delimited blocks, and AsciiDoc table cells may contain other blocks.
Despite the fact that blocks form a hierarchy, even nested blocks start at the left margin.
By requiring blocks to start at the left margin, it avoids the tedium of having to track and maintain levels of indentation and makes the content more reusable.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_text_and_inline_elements">Text and inline elements</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Surrounded by the markers, delimiters, and metadata lines is the text.
The text is the main focus of a document and the reason the AsciiDoc syntax gives it so much room the breathe.
Text is most often found in the lines of a block (e.g., paragraph), the block title (e.g., section title), and in list items, though there are other places where it can exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Text is subject to substitutions.
Substitutions interpret markup as text formatting, replace macros with text or non-text elements, expand attribute references, and perform other sorts of text replacement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normal text is subject to all substitutions, unless specified otherwise.
Verbatim text is subject to a minimal set of substitutions to allow it to be displayed in the output as it appears in the source.
It&#8217;s also possible to disable all substitutions in order to pass the text through to the output unmodified (i.e., raw).
The parsing of text ends up being a mix of inline elements and other forms of transformations.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_encodings_and_asciidoc_files">Encodings and AsciiDoc files</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An AsciiDoc file is a text file that has the <em>.adoc</em> file extension (e.g., <em class="path">document.adoc</em>).
Most AsciiDoc processors assume the text in the file uses UTF-8 encoding.
UTF-16 encodings are supported only if the file starts with a BOM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An AsciiDoc processor can process AsciiDoc from a string (i.e., character sequence).
However, most of the time you&#8217;ll save your AsciiDoc documents to a file.</p>
